Gradle is a build automation system that is fully open source and uses the concepts you see on Apache Maven
and Apache Ant.
(1) it uses domain-specific language based on the programming language Groovy,
Differentiating it from Apache Maven, which uses XML for its project configuration.
(2) it also determines the orders of tasks run by using directed acyclic graph.

Maven is used for project build automation using java.
(1) it helps you map out how a particular software is built, as well as its different dependencies.
(2) it uses an XML file to describe the project that you are building, the dependencies of the software
 with regards to third party modules and parts, the build order, as well as the needed plugins.

 Gradle vs. Maven
 Gradle: based on a graph of task dependencies in which tasks are the things that do the work
 Maven: based on a fixed and linear model of phases.
