a climber is trying to reach a flag that is some height above the ground, 
in the attempt to reach the flag, the climber can make any number of jumps up 
the rock wall where the flag is mounted. movements can only be made up the wall, 
and the climber must end at exactly the height of the flag, 
there are two types of jumps: 
a jump of height 1. a jump of height of bigjump. determine the minimum number os jumps 
it will make the climber to reach the flag's exact height. 
for example: flagHeight =8, bigjump = 3, the climber starts at height 0, 
takes two jumps of height bigjump and two of height 1 to reach exactly 8 units in 4 jumps, 
complete the jumps functions, it accepts the parameters Integer flagHeight, 
and integer bigJump
```c++
#include <cmath>

int jumps(int flagHeight, int bigJump) {
    int jumps = 0;
    int height = 0;
    while (height < flagHeight) {
        height += bigJump;
        jumps++;
        if (height >= flagHeight) break;
        height += 1;
        jumps++;
    }
    if (height > flagHeight) {
        jumps--;
        height -= bigJump;
        jumps += ceil((double)(flagHeight - height) / (double)1);
    }
    return jumps;
}

```
This function uses a loop to continuously jump up the wall by bigJump units until the height 
reaches or exceeds the flag's height. If the height exceeds the flag's height, the loop breaks
and the climber takes the necessary number of small jumps to reach the flag's exact height. 
The ceil function is used to ensure that the correct number of small jumps is taken even if 
the height is not an exact multiple of 1.

a single roll operation on a string is a circular increment of each character by one, 
looking at the english alphabet, characters in the range ascil[a-z], a becomes b, 
b becomes c, and z becomes a. given an array of integers named roll, perform a roll 
operation on the first roll[i] characters of s for each element i in the array. given 
a zero indexed string, an operation roll[i] affects character at positions 0 through 
(roll[i]-1). for example: s ='abz', roll = [3,2,1], perform the following sequence of 
operations: roll[0]=3 roll all three characters so 'abz'becomes 'bca', roll[1]=2; roll 
the first two characters so 'bca' becomes 'cda'. roll[2] =1; roll the first character 
so 'cda' becomes 'dda'. complete the rollTheString function, the function accepts string s  
and integer array roll
```c++
#include <string>

std::string rollTheString(std::string s, const std::vector<int> &roll) {
    for (int i = 0; i < roll.size(); i++) {
        int rollCount = roll[i] % 26;
        for (int j = 0; j < rollCount; j++) {
            for (int k = 0; k < roll[i]; k++) {
                if (s[k] == 'z') {
                    s[k] = 'a';
                } else {
                    s[k]++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return s;
}

```
